        This method is called at the end of every turn (including your playerâ€™s

        use this opportunity to maintain your internal representation of the 
        game state and any other information about the game you are storing.

        The parameter colour will be a string representing the player whose turn
        it is (Red, Green or Blue). The value will be one of the strings "red",

        The parameter action is a representation of the most recent action (or 
        pass) conforming to the above in- structions for representing actions.

        You may assume that action will always correspond to an allowed action 
        (or pass) for the player colour (your method does not need to validate 
        the action/pass against the game rules).
